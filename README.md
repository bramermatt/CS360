# CS360 - Mobile Architect & Programming Class at SNHU!

Matthew Bramer

*Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?*
<br>
The user's needs were to develop an app to track Weight over a certain period of time.

*What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?*
<br>
A login screen, a screen of data, a screen of updating data.

*How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?*
<br>
Developing a wireframe before actually coding the app, test often - I prefer to constantly run the app while developing it to see if what I'm writing is effective and works.

*How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?*
<br>
I tested with multiple numbers of data. The data revealed the program was working properly.

*Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?*
<br>
The entire app was a challange to be overcome, I have never built anything like this before.

*In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?*
<br>
The Login Screen.
