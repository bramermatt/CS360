# CS360 - Mobile Architect & Programming Class at SNHU!

Matthew Bramer

*Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?*
<br>
The user's needs were to develop an app to track Weight over a certain period of time.

*What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?*
<br>
A login screen, a screen of data, a screen of updating data.

*How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?*
<br>
Developing a wireframe before actually coding the app, test often - I prefer to constantly run the app while developing it to see if what I'm writing is effective and works.

*How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?*
<br>
I tested with multiple numbers of data. The data revealed the program was working properly.

*Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?*
<br>
The entire app was a challange to be overcome, I have never built anything like this before.

*In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?*
<br>
The Login Screen.

# 3-2 Milestone Two: Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering Narrative
CS 499 – Computer Science Capstone
Matthew Bramer
May 27, 2024

From the Module One Assignment, I said that I was going to: Refactor Codebase for Modularity and Scalability, Enhance User Interface (UI), Optimize Performance, Implement Additional Features, Document Codebase and Enhancements. A lot to add in an enhancement. What I will be focusing on today is the optimizing performance. At the time of writing, the program is not functional: unable to login. I will be looking into that now. 

1.	Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
1.	This is a Weight Tracking App that was specifically designed for my CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming class. The app is built using Java and I am editing the code in the IDE: Android Central. It was created in August of 2023.

2.	Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?
1.	I selected this item because it was the first and only Android App that I’d ever created. Both personally and scholarly. I hope to show the design and programming as a showcase of my skills and abilities. The program to run, that would be the improvement! (update.. it does!) I added input boxes when adding in the item name, quantity, and the date of creation for the items being added to the weight tracking app! I’m excited to get back working on this now! 

3.	Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
1.	I believe there were a lot of expectations that I had going into this first Module and now that I will be working on the projects again, I might rethink what I’ve said I was going to do. I hope to overcome all issues that arise, and if not, I hope to learn as I go! And again, with the outcome-coverage plans… that was a lot that I said I would do. And again, I’m hopeful to have a functioning program by the end of this course. (it is!) I’m actually going to be making major improvements, specifically the user experience and user interface! 

4.	Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?
1.	Ah, this was a fun project to come back to. I hope to show my joy in creating the program through the experience of using the program. I am having to relearn my workflow using Java, as well as, using Android Central. This was something that I hadn’t used before that class and hadn’t used since. We’ll see how that shows.
